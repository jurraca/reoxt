## Entropy of a Transaction

The idea of this metric comes from a discussion with Greg Maxwell (1).
He was suggesting a notion of "Coinjoin Entropy" measuring how many possible mappings of inputs to outputs are possible given the values of the txos.

Considering that the number of combinations may be very high (b/o the combinatorial explosion created by coinjoin transactions) it's wise to define the notion of entropy:

E = log2(N)

with:
E = entropy of the transaction
N = number of combinations (mappings of inputs to outputs)

Basically, it's the Shannon Entropy with the hypothesis that all events have the same probability (i.e. no additional information giving a "preference" to specific combinations).

Examples

Example 1: Basic Payment Transaction
* N = 1
* E = 0
* The unique interpretation is: [(I1,I2,I3,I4,I5,I6)=>(O1,O2)]


Example 2: Ambiguous Transaction
* N = 2
* E = 1
* Interpretations are:
  - [(I1)=>(O2), (I2)=>(O1)]
  - [(I1,I2)=>(O1,O2)]


Example 3: Basic Coinjoin Transaction (DarkWallet)
* N = 3
* E = 1.585
* Interpretations are:
  - [(I1)=>(O1,O2), (I2)=>(O3,O4)]
  - [(I1)=>(O3,O2), (I2)=>(O1,O4)]
  - [(I1,I2)=>(O1,O2,O3,O4)]
* Note:
  O2 and O4 are the change outputs of the coinjoin transaction.
  For all combinations we have I1=>O2 and I2=>O4.
  We say that I1 is deterministically linked to O2 and I2 is deterministically linked to O4.
